This is a writeup of the forensics challenge Lenore Blum from the CyberHeroines(https://cyberheroines.ctfd.io/) CTF
#### Level: Medium, Score: 300
# Premise

[Lenore Carol Blum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenore_Blum) (nÃ©e Epstein born December 18, 1942) is an American computer scientist and mathematician who has made contributions to the theories of real number computation, cryptography, and pseudorandom number generation. She was a distinguished career professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University until 2019 and is currently a professor in residence at the University of California, Berkeley. She is also known for her efforts to increase diversity in mathematics and computer science. - [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenore_Blum)

# Observations
For this challenge, I strongly reccomend loking at the [official](https://github.com/FITSEC/cyberheroines) writeup of the
challenge, since it actually explains how the challenge works and likely "should" be solved.

In the challenge, we have a numbers game, where we're given a seed and asked to predict the number that the seed will generate.

If you like finding exploits through the following method:

You've come to the right place

# Solution
What I discovered was that, as the game runs, if you spam it enough times, you'll get duplicate seeds.

Since the challenge prints out what the expected result of a seed was, we can use this to our advantage, since
we just need to keep spamming untill we find ourselves a seed appearing twice, as shown here.

![Spam Poc](/assets/images/CHCTF/Lenore/spam_poc.png)

This is done when running the file locally, so we can make an attempt to recreate this "solution" on the live insance, as seen here:
