This is a writeup of the crypto challenge Dizzy from the [TFC CTF](https://ctf.thefewchosen.com) 
#### Points: 50
# Premise
Embark on 'Dizzy', a carousel ride through cryptography! This warmup challenge spins you around the basics of ciphers and keys. Sharpen your mind, find the flag, and remember - in crypto, it's fun to get a little dizzy!

# Observations
We can attempt to identify what cipher is used with the cipher identifier from [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), which gives us [letters positions](https://www.dcode.fr/letter-positions) as its top result.

# Solution
When decoding the ciphertext in the `letters positions`decoder, we get the following result:

`TFCCTF{th_chllng_mks_m_dzzy_;d}`, which looks like a flag, but its not a complete one.

The cipher we have is one were a characters position in the string comes directly after the letter. 

As we can see, the string we have doesnt contain any number, but as we can see from the following entries in the ciphertext `510 320 414 317 423 329 19 325 132`, we can see that we're missing a `5` in position `10`, `3` in position `20` and so on.

Placing these numbers into the partial flag found earlier gives us the actual flag:

`TFCCTF{th15_ch4ll3ng3_m4k3s_m3_d1zzy_;d}`
