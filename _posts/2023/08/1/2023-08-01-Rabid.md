This is a writeup of the crypto challenge Rabid from the [TFC CTF](https://ctf.thefewchosen.com) 
#### Points: 50
# Premise
There might be a little **extra** piece of information here.


## Challenge chiphertext:

VEZDQ1RGe13kwdV9yNGIxZF9kMGc/IT8hPyE/IT8hPi8+Pz4/PjEyMzkwamNhcHNrZGowOTFyYW5kb21sZXR0ZXJzYW5kbnVtYmVyc3JlZWVlMmozfQ==

# Observations
When viewing our encoded string, we can see that we're dealing with a base64 string. 
- (Note: If you want to be extra sure, you can use a tool like [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier))

When decoding the string, we find it to only be partially decoded, since we can identify the `TFCCTF{` piece of the string.

# Solution
If we walk to the part of the string that starts **after** the `TFCCTF{` part of the encoded string, we can see if changing the string by for instance removing a character changes the result, so we remove the `1` from the `VEZDQ1RGe13kwdV9yNGIxZF9kMGc` portion of the string.
This gives us the following result, containing the flag: `TFCCTF{y0u_r4b1d_d0g?!?!?!?!?!>/>?>?>12390jcapskdj091randomlettersandnumbersreeee2j3}`
