This is a writeup of the network challenge The shark from the [Security Valley](https://ctf.securityvalley.org) CTF
#### Level: 1, Score: 5
# Premise
There is pcapng file. Can you reveal the authentication credentials?

**Link:** [https://github.com/SecurityValley/PublicCTFChallenges/tree/master/network/the_shark](https://github.com/SecurityValley/PublicCTFChallenges/tree/master/network/the_shark)
## Challenge files:
auth_sniff.pcapng
# Observations
When opening the file in [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), we see some TCP and HTTP traffic. 

The HTTP traffic sends several requests to an api at `/api/v1/auth`. 

If we follow the HTTP stream of these requests, we see 2 requests that return a `401 Unauthorized`
and one that returns a `200 OK`

# Solution
If we look at the content sent before the `200 OK`request, we can see the following:
```
GET /api/v1/auth HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic c2VjdmFsOlNlY1ZhbHs4NDVJYzR1N2hfaTVfNVVQM1JfNWhJN30=
User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.26.8
Accept: */*
Postman-Token: 4a8745d5-69b5-4024-97c6-e4058a6bc3bd
Host: localhost:7777
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```
The string in the Authorization header seem to be base64 encoded, so we can simply decode it with a tool like [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

The decoded string is: `secval:SecVal{[REDACTED]}`
