This is a writeup of the crypto challenge XOR pain from the [Security Valley](https://ctf.securityvalley.org) CTF

# Premise
There is a piece of code and a text file. Make it work!!

**Link:** [https://github.com/SecurityValley/PublicCTFChallenges/tree/master/crypto/xor_hell](https://github.com/SecurityValley/PublicCTFChallenges/tree/master/crypto/xor_hell)

## Challenge code:
peace_of_code.py
```python
#/usr/bin/python3

def read_flag_from_disk():
    with open("./challenge.txt") as flag:
        return bytes.fromhex(flag.read().strip())

def xor(flag, key):
    out = b""

    for i in range(len(flag)):
        out += bytes([flag[i] ^ key[i % len(key)]])

    return out

def main():
    
    res = xor(
        read_flag_from_disk(),
        b"0"
    )

    print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Challenge ciphertext:
```
3c0804390c0b1415571d321307083807080b0332081a1938000b381602124e10
```
# Solution
We have 2 strengths in this challenge that we're going to have to utilize. The one is the fact that XORing is reversible, the second is that we know the flag format, that being `SecVal{flag}`. because we know the first 6 characters, `SecVal`, we can use a [Known-plaintext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack). 

We can do this by using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef) and using the from hex and XOR brute force modules. We can then take the first 4 characters from the encoded string, and take the result that match our sought after string. In the case of the first characters, it is `Se` which gives us `6f6d`, for `cV` we get the key  `676f` and for the final 2 characters, `al` we get the last piece of the key, `6d67`. 

We can string these 3 pieces together to get the full key: `6f6d676f6d67`. If we now remove the XOR bruteforce decoder from CyberChef and replace it with a simple XOR and enter our key, we can run it against the full ciphertext.

Doing this with the the ciphertext prints out the flag: `SecVal{[REDACTED]}`
