This is a writeup of the forensics challenge LIST from the [TFC CTF](https://ctf.thefewchosen.com) 
#### Points: 50

# Observations
Analyzing the traffic, we can determine that some filtering is going to be required.

After a while of tweaking, I found the most useful data to be in HTTP POST requests, except for 2 where they were not needed, so they got filtered out as well. Ultimately this was the filter we ended up with:
`!ocsp  &&  http.request.method == POST and !(tcp.stream eq 185) and !(tcp.stream eq 186)`
Which gave us the following traffic as a result:
![POST traffic](/assets/images/TFCCTF/list/list_post_traffic.png)
# Solution
Following these HTTP streams gave us several different strings that looked to be base64 encoded.

![b64 strings](/assets/images/TFCCTF/list/list_example_string.png)

We can also trim off some excess from the strings themselves, so we only decode the actual base64 string.
Doing this gives us lines like the following:
![b64 decoded strings](/assets/images/TFCCTF/list/list_b64_decoding.png)

All these lines together give us the following:

![all b64 decoded](/assets/images/TFCCTF/list/list_decoded_chars.png)


Which when trimmed gives us the following result:


![flag](/assets/images/TFCCTF/list/list_flag.png)

Which gives us our flag: `TFCCTF{b4s3_64_isnt_that_g00d}`
