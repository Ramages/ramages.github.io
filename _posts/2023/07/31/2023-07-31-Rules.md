This is a writeup of the misc challenge Rules from the [TFC CTF](https://ctf.thefewchosen.com) 
#### Points: 50
# Premise

Let's have fun together, by reading the rules.

## Challenge link:

[Rules from the CTF](https://ctf.thefewchosen.com/rules)

# Observations
This challenge is quite simple, we, as it says, go and read the rules.
# Solution
On the rules page, we have two options. Intuitively, I would assume its not the `TFCCTF{anything_goes_here}` flag, but we can try this as well for good measure, however as I assumed, this is not our flag.

This leaves us with the other flag option visible on the page, `TFCCTF{Th15_3d1t10n_15_rus7y!}` which we try and find is the correct flag.
