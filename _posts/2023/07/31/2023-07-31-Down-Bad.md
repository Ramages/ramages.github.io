# Solution
An good first step to do in a challenge with an image is checking it with a tool like https://fotoforensics.com/, so we navigate there and upload the image.
At first, with the ELA filter, we get no results.

Moving down the list to the left however, we skip Games and go to Hidden Pixels,

Here, at the bottom of the image, we find the flag:`TFCCTF{28ae25c96850245ffdd70a880158f9f3}`
