This is a writeup of the Forensics challenge pingpong by [swampCTF](https://swampctf.com/) 
#### Points: 53
# Premise
What happened to my traffic??? The pings?!?? They're taking over!!!! They're... ping... pong pingpong ping find my pong flag.

## Challenge files:

[traffic.pcap](https://ctf.swampctf.com/files/b4fe5cd29ccc9e7aaae92007a7a81801/traffic.pcap)

# Observations
Opening the file, we saw a lot of pings, but the data didnt seem to comprehensible at first, but scrolling down a bit, I found the following:

![b64 data](/assets/images/swampCTF/pingpong/b64.png)

Which looks an awfull lot like base64 encoded data, so I go back to the first package, and try to base64 decode it using Cyberchef, and see the following:

![png data found](/assets/images/swampCTF/pingpong/png_found.png)

# Solution

So, we know we have a few ICMP packets that we need to extract the data from, decode from base64, and render as an image.
To do this, the first thing I do is to save the packets as json data, and name the file ```icmp.json``` followed by writing this python script:
```python
import json
import base64
import io
import PIL.Image as Image

with open('icmp.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

#We're after _source -> layers -> icmp -> data -> data.data

img_str = ""

for i in data:
    #print(i.get("_source").get("layers").get("icmp").get("data").get("data.data"))
    img_str += i.get("_source").get("layers").get("icmp").get("data").get("data.data")
    
the_str = img_str.replace(":", "")
#print(the_str)
hexbytes = bytes.fromhex(the_str).decode('utf-8')
#print(hexbytes)
b64_decoded_str = base64.b64decode(hexbytes)

#print(b64_decoded_str)
img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(b64_decoded_str))
img.show()
```

This extracts the image and shows us the following:
![flag](/assets/images/swampCTF/pingpong/pingpong.png)

So now we have the flags:
> swampCTF{d474_15_3v3rywh3r3}
{: .prompt-tip }
